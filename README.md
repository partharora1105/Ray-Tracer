# Ray-Tracer

This project focuses on rendering a 3D star using ray tracing techniques in the Processing IDE. Ray tracing is a powerful method for simulating the way light interacts with objects to generate realistic images. In this project, we leverage ray tracing to create a visually stunning representation of a 3D star.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/partharora1105/Ray-Tracer.git
   ```

2. Open the project in the Processing IDE.

3. Run the sketch to see the 3D star rendered using ray tracing.

## Usage

1. Open the `main.pde` file in the Processing IDE.

2. Explore the code to understand how the ray tracing algorithm is implemented and how the 3D star is modeled.

3. Experiment with the parameters such as camera position, light sources, and star properties to customize the rendering.

4. Run the sketch to visualize the changes and observe the impact on the final image.
